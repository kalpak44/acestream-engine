#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is usually handled by the user. In a typical work environment, you may want to share these.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#1255, lock files should be placed under source control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you are working on a library, you should ignore them.
#   For applications, you should not ignore them.
